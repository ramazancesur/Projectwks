NuGet Java Feed
================

This is a simple Java application to host your 
own NuGet Feed. All you need to have is 
a folder with NuGet packages (.nupkg files) 
and Java runtime.

To start the server use the following commandline:

    java -jar standalone-nuget-feed.jar <path to packages folder> [/url:<server url>]

Where:
 <path to packages folder>  is path to .nupkg files
 <server url>               is url to bind server to,
                            i.e. http://localhost:8888/nuget/feed

The server will monitor any changes in the packages folder to update the feed.
